# Heavy-Python-Projects
**Loops**(For & while), **Conditional Statements**(Only where its required) & **Functions** **"**have been Heavily used**"**; 

**Highly Mathematically oriented Logic** with minimal use of python libraries 

(just as a way to show off my Mathematical & CS Thinking and reasoning abilities haha)

(Will practice and master recursion too, will use it soon in later projects)

### Description of the Projects/Problems


1. [**Permutations**](https://github.com/SAURAV2007YO/Heavy-Python-Projects/blob/main/1.%20Permutations%20(for%20All).py) (A Beautiful one):
made a great State counter, using and converting **"A Great Mathematical Logic"** into python code, maybe could have used recursion idk.

Made this project intitally only [for strings with all unique charecters](https://github.com/SAURAV2007YO/Heavy-Python-Projects/blob/main/1.%20Permutations%20(unique%20Char%20only).py); when it worked, extended the logic to support [any string](https://github.com/SAURAV2007YO/Heavy-Python-Projects/blob/main/1.%20Permutations%20(for%20All).py) (there are 2 files, 1 for each version)

2. [**Number Spiral Square**](https://github.com/SAURAV2007YO/Heavy-Python-Projects/blob/main/2.%20Number%20Spiral%20Square.py)  (Beautiful):
used 1/2 pre-calculated math formulas(on the paper) to avoid recursion hell, had to write many different loops for this one

3. [**Longest unique substring**](https://github.com/SAURAV2007YO/Heavy-Python-Projects/blob/main/3.%20Longest%20Unique%20Substring.py):
Used Lists as the substitute for dictionaries, both use the same amount of compute power.  had to write more code because of using lists

4. [**Nearby Pythagorean Triplets Discoverer**](https://github.com/SAURAV2007YO/Heavy-Python-Projects/blob/main/4.%20(simple%20one)%20Nearby%20Pythagorean%20Triplets%20Discoverer.py) & [**List Ascending order**](https://github.com/SAURAV2007YO/Heavy-Python-Projects/blob/main/4.%20(Simple%20one)%20List%20Ascending%20Order.py):
Nothing much special

5. [**Thala for a Reason**](https://github.com/SAURAV2007YO/Heavy-Python-Projects/blob/main/5.%20Thala%20for%20a%20Reason.py):
Unusual mix of tools, which are not used together generally; a Meme project

### Note:
- Not meant to be production-efficient code.
- Will explore even more elegant structures, recursion etc.. soon.
