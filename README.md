# Heavy-Python-Projects
**Loops**(For & while), **Conditional Statements**(Only where its required) & **Functions** **"**have been Heavily used**"**; 

**Highly Mathematically oriented Logic** with minimal use of python libraries 

(just as a way to show off my Mathematical & CS Thinking and reasoning abilities haha)

but will nicely learn/practice and use recursion in further projects.

Description about the Projects(Should maybe call them problems idk)

1. **Permutations** (A Beautiful one):
made a great State counter, using and converting **"A Great Mathematical Logic"** into python code, maybe could have used recursion idk. Made this project intitally only strings with all unique charecters; when it worked, extended the logic to support any string (there are 2 files, 1 for each version)

2. **Number Spiral Square**  (Beautiful):
used 1/2 pre-calculated math formulas(on the paper) to avoid recursion hell, had to write many different loops for this one

3. **Longest unique substring**:
Used Lists as the substitute for dictionaries, both of them would have used the same amount of compute power.  had to write more code because of using lists

4. **Nearby Pythagorean Triplets Discoverer** & **List Ascending order**:
Nothing much special

5. **Thala for a Reason**:
Unusual mix of tools, which are not used together generally; a Meme project
